## README

This is a quick sample Ruby on Rails app using Refills, Bourbon, Bitters, and Neat (all created by Thoughtbot). This app is a rough reference for you to jump-start your Ruby on Rails project using Refills. Please visit [Official Refills website](http://refills.bourbon.io/) for complete code samples.

This app uses ruby 2.0.0 and rails 4.1.4
I've also postgresql to deploy to heroku and gem 'rails_12factor' to serve assets.

## USAGE

Download the repo to your computer.

From your terminal, cd into the folder

install all the gems

```
bundle
```
start your server

```
rails s
```
That's it! Visit http://localhost:3000/

I've created a simple controller for the home page. Nothing else. Check the app/assets/stylesheets and app/assets/javascripts folder for custom configurations.

###Have fun!
